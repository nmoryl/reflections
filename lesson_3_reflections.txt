When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  When you are using multiple machines for development or if you are developing
  as part of a team. You may also want a remote repository for disaster
  recovery or backup purposes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because if someone else pushes changes to your remote repository that may
  break your work-in-progress.
