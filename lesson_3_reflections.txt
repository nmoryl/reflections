When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  When you are using multiple machines for development or if you are developing
  as part of a team. You may also want a remote repository for disaster
  recovery or backup purposes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because if someone else pushes changes to your remote repository that may
  break your work-in-progress.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

  You would fork a repository that you don't own but want to modify for your
  own purposes; and that repository is available on GitHub. (Forking is a
  GitHub-specific concept.) You would clone a repository if you want to create
  a copy of it. You would clone after a fork, for example, if you want to
  develop on a repository that you don't own (most people don't develop in
  the cloud, though that may change.) There are instances where you would clone
  on your own machine, but I'm not currently familiar with those use cases.
  You create a branch to develop on a repository you own. That repo could be a
  remote one or a local one.
