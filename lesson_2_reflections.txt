What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  When you initialize a repository, git knows it needs to track it. By default,
  a folder is not tracked. Git doesn't automatically track things or save
  changes. You can have folders anywhere on your computer that you are
  tracking through git. They don't all have to be in the same parent directory.
  You need to initialize a repository for git to track the version history of
  a directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

  It allows you time to consider and review what you want to track before
  committing it.
